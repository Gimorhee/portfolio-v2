        These projects are custom built upon our clients' design and
        functionality request from Onikon Creative Inc. I was responsible for
        developing all UI pages and functionalities and implementing our custom
        built IDX API Plugins.

      <div className="Project-Note">
        <p>
          By working on these projects, I learned a lot on PHP and one of the
          most famous CMS tools, Wordpress. Plus, my design and CSS skills have
          been significantly improved and I am currently working on implementing
          new designs and features on our custom built IDX API plugins using Vue
          and Vuesax üëç.
