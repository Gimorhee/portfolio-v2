            I'm currently working as a Frontend Developer at{" "}

          <p>
            As a Developer, I truly enjoy bridging the gap between design and
            engienering â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
            design to build a beautiful product. I derive great satisfaction
            from buliding better, more efficient code as well as working in
            details and designs of the product to achieve superb UX/UI.
